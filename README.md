<h1 align="center">Cracking the Coding Interview</h1>

[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com) is a fine book, but it suffers from one inexpiable shortcoming: the solutions are all in Java! This project exists to ameliorate this particular failing.


Usage
-----

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd src
    pytest

Notes
-----

- Taken from Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition
- Solutions developed against Python 3.6.2
- Solutions are divided into exercises (files prefixed with 'e') and the actual questions (files prefixed with 'q').
